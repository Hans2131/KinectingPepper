## How to make changes

### Make a branch
We use [Feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

Use the task's Scrumwise code as the start of the branch name.

### Make your changes

Make your changes to the code and commit it onto your branch and push it to Github.

### Make a pull request

While you are working on your code or when you are done you can make a pull request on github.
Make the title of the pull request the branch code and explain what you did in the description.

### Request a review

Once you are confident your code is complete you can request a code review on your pull request.

#### Reviewing code

To review code you will try to run the project locally. 
You must confirm that it runs correctly and has the requested functionality of the scrumwise task.

### Merge

When you pull request is approved you can merge it.
Currently, only squash-merge is allowed.
This means that all the commits on the branch with be merged into a singular commit on the master branch.
